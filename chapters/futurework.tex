While the method of sharing connection parameters within the advertisement data works, it requires compliance from the central to work. Further research could focus on standardizing the procedures around sharing the connection parameters so that other platforms can support this feature and Bluetooth Low-Energy becomes more hospitable to batteryless devices.

Although Fast Reconnect covers all link-layer communication used by our demo application, further testing needs to be done to assess if our method can be applied to all link-layer exchanges. A generic approach built into the link layer controller would be ideal and would guarantee support for future revisions of BLE.

Finally, while FRAPPUCcInO provides some promising initial results, it is clear that further work is required to improve stability and optimize the algorithm further. A combination of using \textit{Fast Reconnect} and the regular \textit{connection parameter update request} as the methods of applying parameters could prove even more effective.
