We have presented a new method of reducing connection setup overhead and energy usage in Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) for battery-less devices, as well as conventional battery-powered devices. This method is called Fast Reconnect and is platform agnostic. Fast Reconnect applies caching in multiple levels of the BLE stack, from the GATT layer, all the way down to the link layer, to reduce the connection setup process to a single packet. To improve connection parameter adaption time within FreeBie, we also presented FRAPPUCcInO, which combines Fast Reconnect with a control system to improve throughput and responsiveness under highly variable energy harvesting conditions. Using Fast Reconnect, together with FRAPPUCcInO, intermittent devices can become smaller, perform with even less ambiently available energy, and even enjoy a more responsive user experience.
